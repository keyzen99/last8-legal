# Privacy Policy (Note Check)

Last updated: 2026-02-20

## 1. Overview
Note Check (the "App") is an offline tool for quick pitch checks before going on stage.
We respect your privacy and keep the App minimal.

## 2. Information We Collect
The App does not collect personal information such as your name, email address, precise location, advertising ID, or similar identifiers.

## 3. Information Stored on Your Device
For convenience, the App may store a small set of settings locally on your device, such as:
- Display/operation settings (e.g., octave)
- Sustain state and similar preferences to restore on next launch

This data stays on your device and is not sent to any developer server.

## 4. Network Access
The App does not perform network communication during normal use.

## 5. Sharing with Third Parties
The App does not share your data with third parties (we do not collect personal data).

## 6. Third-Party SDKs / Ads / Analytics
The App does not use advertising SDKs, analytics SDKs, or tracking SDKs.

## 7. Purchases (Pro Features)
If Pro features are offered, payments are processed by Apple/Google platforms (App Store / Google Play).
We do not receive or store your payment card information.

## 8. Children’s Privacy
The App is designed not to collect personal information.

## 9. Changes
We may update this policy to reflect changes in the App or legal requirements. Updates will be posted on this page.

## 10. Contact
